# Task List in This Directory:

These tasks were implemented by me during my second year at Moscow State University in the Faculty of Applied Mathematics and Informatics. The course focused on computer practicals.

To interact with the program, input values into the "in.txt" file. The desired result will be written to the "out.txt" file.

## [basic algorithms](https://github.com/dream1ike/contest-1-semester-msu/tree/main/basic%20algorithms "basic algorithms")
- ### [1. processing_sequences](https://github.com/dream1ike/contest-1-semester-msu/tree/main/basic%20algorithms/1.%20processing_sequences "1. processing_sequences")
  - ✅ ascents - Count the number of increasing sections in the sequence.
  - ✅ differences - Count the number of distinct elements in a non-decreasing sequence.
  - ✅ length - Find the length of the longest increasing section.

- ### [2. working_with_arrays](https://github.com/dream1ike/contest-1-semester-msu/tree/main/basic%20algorithms/2.%20working_with_arrays "2. working_with_arrays")
  - ✅ binom - Calculate binomial coefficients.
  - ✅ segments - Replace elements of each x-segment with the half-sum of the elements adjacent to x.
  - ✅ symmetry - Check if the values of the array elements are symmetric.

- ###  [3. bit operations](https://github.com/dream1ike/contest-1-semester-msu/tree/main/basic%20algorithms/3.%20bit%20operations "3. bit operations")
  - ✅ mirrors - Calculate N bitwise mirror images of a number.

- ### [4. sorts](https://github.com/dream1ike/contest-1-semester-msu/tree/main/basic%20algorithms/4.%20sorts "4. sorts") 
  - ✅ comb sort
  - ✅ insertion sort
  - ✅ quicksort
  - ✅ selection sort
  - ✅ shaker sort

## [discrete_math](https://github.com/dream1ike/contest-1-semester-msu/tree/main/discrete_math "discrete_math") 

- ###  [1. algebra_of_logi](https://github.com/dream1ike/contest-1-semester-msu/tree/main/discrete_math/1.%20algebra_of_logi "1. algebra_of_logi")
	- ✅ samo && samodvoystvennost - Checks if a function from boolean algebra is self-dual. Implemented using multiple algorithms (arrays and boolean algebra operations in C).

- ### [2. k-digit logic](https://github.com/dream1ike/contest-1-semester-msu/tree/main/discrete_math/2.%20k-digit%20logic "2. k-digit logic")
	- ✅ save - Given a function's vector values in the input file, find all sets it preserves. Write each set to the output file as a separate line, ordered lexicographically.

- ### [4. Minimizing DNF](https://github.com/dream1ike/contest-1-semester-msu/tree/main/discrete_math/4.%20Minimizing%20DNF "4. Minimizing DNF") 
	- ✅ quine_mcCluskey - Given a function's vector values in the input file, construct its minimized Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) using the Quine-McCluskey algorithm.
