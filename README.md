# Task List in This Directory:

These tasks were implemented by me during my second year at Moscow State University in the Faculty of Applied Mathematics and Informatics. The course focused on computer practicals.

To interact with the program, input values into the "in.txt" file. The desired result will be written to the "out.txt" file.
